# VulkanModelViewer
A predecessor to the OpenGLViewer. Mostly based on [vulkan-tutorial.com](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/).<br>Uses GLFW, glm, [stb-image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) and [tinyobjloader](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader). <br>It loads an .obj file and currently supports meshes with a singular material and texture, as working with Vulkan requires some advanced mental gymnastics (though it is worth it performance-wise - it makes coils whine on my graphics card).<br>
